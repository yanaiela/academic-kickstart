I am a second year Phd student in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~nlp/) at [Bar-Ilan University](http://cs.biu.ac.il), under the supervision of [Prof. Yoav Goldberg](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yoavg/uni/).  
I also work as a research intern at [AI2 Israel](https://allenai.org/ai2-israel/).

My interests lie between Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

I am also co-organizing an online NLP seminar: [NLP with Friends](https://nlpwithfriends.com/), along with [Abhilasha Ravichander](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aravicha/), [Liz Salesky](https://esalesky.github.io/) and [Zeerak Waseem](https://twitter.com/ZeerakW). Join us!
